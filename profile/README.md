# KotlinCrypto

Cryptographic components for Kotlin Multiplatform.

Recognizing a need for native language cryptography for multiplatform, a 
long-term play was made with the creation of `KotlinCrypto` in February 
2023 by [Matthew Nelson][url-05nelsonm].

With a focus on modularity (import what you need, not every cryptographic 
function under the sun), security and well constructed APIs, this organization 
hopes to become the go-to place for Kotlin Multiplatform devs' cryptography 
needs.
