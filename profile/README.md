# KotlinCrypto

Cryptographic components for Kotlin Multiplatform.

Founded in February 2023 by [Matthew Nelson][url-05nelsonm] who was tired 
of importing massive crypto libraries for 2 or 3 functions. So, with a focus 
on modularity, security and well constructed APIs, a long-term play was made 
with the creation of `KotlinCrypto`.

Help in building what will hopefully become the go-to place for Kotlin 
Multiplatform devs and their crypto needs is much welcomed; drop a line!
